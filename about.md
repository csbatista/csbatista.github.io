I'm an Industrial Informatics technician, Computer Science Bachelor student, design enthusiast and an free-time skater! I've started more personal projects that I can count, read more books that I could talk about and traveled to much more places than I imagined I ever would. Still, I have so many new projects to start, books to read and places to travel to. I love to talk and tell stories, but I also love to know about people's lives and experiences, and also hear as many tips as possible. A lot of things in life are complicated, and if someone has been through similar things before, their tips are just priceless :)
