Hello World!

I've decided to add this section on the website so I could write a bit. Besides being good for my writting skills, I believe that this project can help me learn new things. The goal here is to write posts about front-end so I can practice new stuff and give a purpose to what I've been developing :) But I think (I'm pretty sure actally) that the subject of the posts will extend to other areas. Having a blog does wonders on our our critical thinking, helps organize ideas and also show our points of view on things that happens around us. Ah! It is also a perfect way to documment the thoughts and many years from now I can come back and read what I thought today (as I do with blogs that I had online someday :P)

I don't know if I can keep a good post frequency, since it is the last semester of my bachelor and I know that later on the semester things will get hard. But let's see what happens, right?

Some nice things about the website+blog:

- I made it using Jekyll ([and this course by William Justen, in portuguese](http://willianjusten.teachable.com/courses/criando-sites-estaticos-com-jekyll)), and I've gotta say: what an amazing thing! How did I not know about this?
- It is still under construction and I think it will be forever. I hurried to finish to keep myself motivated with the posts idea, so there are some things that might still need some work, but I also think that I will never be 100% satisfied :)
